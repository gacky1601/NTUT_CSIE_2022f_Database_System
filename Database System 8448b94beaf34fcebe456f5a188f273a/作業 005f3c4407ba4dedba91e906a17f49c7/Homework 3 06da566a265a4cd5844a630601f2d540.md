STUDENT(StudentNumber, Name, Class, Major)

COURSE(CourseNumber, CourseName, CreditHour, Department)

SECTION(SectionNumber, CourseNumber, Semester, Year, Instructor)

GRADE_REPORT(StudentNumber, SectionNumber, Grade)

PREREQUISITE(CourseNumber, PrerequisiteCourseNumber)

Specify the following queries in SQL.

(a) Change the credit hours of the course 'Database Systems' for the ' EECS' department to 3.

```sql
UPDATE COURSE
SET CreditHour=3
WHERE Department='EECS' AND 
CourseName='Database Systems';
```

(b) Delete the record for the student whose name is 'Edward' and whose student number is '001'.

```sql
DELETE FROM STUDENT
WHERE Name='Edward' AND StudentNumber='001';
```

(c) Retrieve the names of all courses taught by Professor 'Liu' in years 2020 and 2022.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CourseName
FROM COURSE AS C
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON C.CourseNumber=S.Coursenumber
WHERE S.Instructor='Liu' AND
(S.Year BETWEEN 2020 AND 2022);
```

(d) For each section taught by Professor 'Liu', retrieve the course number, semester, year, and the number of students who took the section.

```sql
SELECT S.CourseNumber, S.Semester, S.Year, Count(STU.Name)
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber

GROUP BY S.CourseNumber, 
S.Semester,
S.Year,
S.Sectionnumber;
```

(e) Retrieve the prerequisite course number and name for the course 'Web Programming' offered by the 'EECS' department.

```sql
SELECT PC.CourseNumber, PC.CourseName
From PREREQUISITE AS P
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C
ON C.Coursenumber=P.CourseNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS PC
ON PC.CourseNumber=P.PrerequisiteCourseNumber
WHERE C.CourseName='Web Programming' AND. 
C.Department='EECS';
```

(f) Retrieve the name and transcript of each junior student (Class=3) majoring in 'EECS'. A transcript includes course number, course name, credit hours, semester, year, and grade for each course completed by the student.

```sql
SELECT STU.Name, S.CourseNumber, C.CourseName, 
C.CreditHour, S.Semester, S.Year, 
AVG(G.Grade) AS grade
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber 
WHERE STU.Name=name AND STU.Class=3
GROUP BY STU.Name, S.CourseNumber, C.CourseName, 
C.CreditHour, S.semester, S.Year;
```

(g) Retrieve the names of students who have a grade greater than or equal to 80 in all of their courses.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT STU.Name
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C 
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber
GROUP BY STU.Name, S.CourseNumber 
HAVING AVG(G.grade) > 80;
```

(h) Retrieve the names and major departments of all students who do not have a grade below 60 in any of their courses.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT STU.Name, STU.Major
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C 
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber
GROUP BY STU.Name, STU.Major, S.CourseNumber 
HAVING AVG(G.grade) > 60;
```

(i) Retrieve the names and majors of all students who have a grade below 60 in any of their courses, order alphabetically by the student number.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT STU.Name, STU.Major
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN (
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT
ORDER BY StudentNumber
) AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C 
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber
GROUP BY STU.Name, STU.Major, S.CourseNumber
HAVING AVG(G.grade) < 60;
```

(j) Retrieve the names and their average grades for the students who have an average grade greater than 80.0 in year 2022.

```sql
SELECT S.Name, AVG(R.grade)
FROM STUDENT AS S
INNER JOIN (
SELECT STU.Name, C.CourseName, AVG(G.Grade) as grade
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber
WHERE S.Year=2022
GROUP BY STU.Name, C.CourseName
) AS R
ON S.Name=R.Name
GROUP BY S.Name
HAVING AVG(R.grade) >=80;
```

(k) For each department (i.e., student major), list the number of students whose average grade is below 60.0.

```sql
SELECT D.Major, COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Major FROM STUDENT) AS D
INNER JOIN (
SELECT S.Name, S.Major
FROM STUDENT AS S
INNER JOIN (
SELECT STU.Name, STU.Major, C.CourseName,

GROUP BY STU.Name, C.CourseName, STU.Major
) AS R
ON S.Name=R.Name
GROUP BY S.Name, S.Major
HAVING AVG(R.grade) <60
) AS R
ON R.Major=D.Major
GROUP BY D.Major;
```

(i) Create a view that has student ID, student name, the names of the courses took by the student, the semester and the year that the courses offered, and  the grade received by the student for the courses.

```sql
CREATE VIEW view AS
SELECT STU.StudentNumber, STU.Name, C.CourseName,
S.Year, S.Semester, AVG(G.Grade) as grade
FROM GRADE_REPORT AS G
INNER JOIN STUDENT AS STU
ON STU.StudentNumber = G.StudentNumber
INNER JOIN SECTION AS S
ON S.SectionNumber=G.SectionNumber
INNER JOIN COURSE AS C
ON S.CourseNumber=C.CourseNumber
WHERE S.Year=2022
GROUP BY STU.StudentNumber, STU.Name,
C.CourseName, S.Year, S.Semester;
```

2. Choose a DBMS (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL or MySQL) to create and populate the tables in problem 1.

(a) Show your SQL statements and the execution results (screen snapshots) for creating the tables. The SQL statements need to specify the key and referential constraints (i.e., primary key and foreign key) for each table.
